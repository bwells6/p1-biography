<h3>Background Information</h3>

<p>My name is Bryan Wells I am 31 years old and live in Spokane Washington. I currently work at Fasteners Inc. and am also attending Eastern Washington University. I live in northern Spokane with my fiance&#39; Jenna, and our 4 year old daughter Mckinley. I went to Spokane Community College a little bit after high school and received my Associate of Arts degree. I ended up getting the job I am currently in, met the girl of my dreams, and had a little girl which put my schooling on a bit of a hold. Now I am in my last year of my bachelors degree in Visual Communication and Design with a Business minor and can"t wait to start looking for internships, finish school, and start a career.</p>

<h3>Professional Objectives</h3>

<p>When I first got into this degree my cousin and I had this vision of owning our own web and graphic design firm. He currently is in the web design field and I am getting close to graduating. After school I think that I will try and get an entry level design job to see what it is like to be out in the field in that kind of environment. While I would love one day to own my own company, I must first get my feet wet and see where my career in design takes me.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>In my free time I love to spend as much time with my family as I can. I like to snowboard, golf, dirt bike, and almost anything else outdoors like camping and fishing. I love to travel when we have enough free time. I have a younger brother and sister that also have kids and one of my favorite things is when all of our families get together to hang out.</p>
